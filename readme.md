Using the MERN stack, replicate the card design from the following reference:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/10J694Y53N_vAyBR7ovQIpVop6KgEmwB1/view

Build the card as a React component and render all its content dynamically by fetching data from a backend API connected to a database (MongoDB Atlas or any cloud-hosted DB).

Once completed, deploy the frontend (e.g., on Vercel) and the backend (e.g., on Render or Railway), and share the live link(s) along with the GitHub repository.

You may use Tailwind CSS or any other CSS framework for styling.
